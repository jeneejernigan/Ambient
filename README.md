                                            (Using Blockchain To Award Loyalty Rewards.)


Introduction:

Blockchain is a hot new technology which is expected to revolutionize business and redefine companies and economies. So before stepping into how we will use this technology in Ambient let us discuss the phenomenon. 
A blockchain is a ledger of facts, replicated across several computers assembled in a peer to peer network. By facts, we mean it can be anything from monetary transactions to content signatures. Every member in the network will be anonymous and will be represented as a Node. Cryptography will be used to identify a sender and a receiver whenever a communication occurs. Suppose a node wants to add facts to the ledger, a consensus called a block will be formed in the network to determine where this facts should appear in the ledger;

Problem Statement:

In todayâ€™s business world, customer loyalty, engagement and their satisfaction are given much priority as they can make or break companies. Here comes in the customer rewards programs, that represent a strategic investment by the companies to keep their business growing. Even though the rewards programs are growing in a faster pace, we can observe a lot of inefficiencies in the point systems and redemption options which are cumbersome. Some examples include: Points spread across too many programs to earn significant rewards, delays getting access to points and  inconsistent experiences across different programs.
Hence, in Ambient we plan to use a blockchain based rewards solution wherein the reward program providers, administrators, customers and other parties interact in a single system without a need to compromise in competitive advantage or privacy thus providing real time transparency. This would help the organizations save a lot of money that they spend on personnel and administrative costs. We also plan to use smart contracts to interact with existing loyalty and rewards program platforms using digital wallets and social media channels.

Working Methodology:

Blockchain has the potential in creation, redemption and exchange of rewards points in real-time. This will be done across a secure platform using a rigorous online protocol, well programmed building blocks and smart contracts that will be used across rewards programs, vendors and industries. This rewards network will have the following features in it:

Rewards application:

This would be the point of entry to the the rewards network (via digital wallet) . This part of the application would have customer identities as digital signatures and the values as reward points or tokens.

Rewards points or tokens:

When a rewards transaction is initialized (issuance, redemption or exchange) the blockchain protocol would create an algorithm generating a rewards points. This would be called as a block and each block for a unique customer would be linked to his previous blocks thus updating the customers ledger. This ledger would be made available across the network thus allowing secured transparency. 

Rewards network platform:

This part of application would help in connecting various organizations and their loyalty programs which would helps the customers to interact with other rewards programs that they have across a different network and help them in converting and exchanging their points accordingly.

A visual representation of the above concept would look as follows:


Requirement for implementation:

        - Decent amount of customers and loyalty program providers
        - Accepted protocols and standardization.
